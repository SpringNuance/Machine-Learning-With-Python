    "Machine learning (ML) studies methods that enable a computer to learn from data. ML methods fit models to data in order to be able to make accurate predictions and/or inferences about phenomena such as the weather or the behavior of humans. The range of ML applications is overwhelming. ML methods can predict the grade of a cancerous tumour based on histological images or identify the main customer segments of a shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This round introduces some basic concepts behind many ML methods. A main theme of this course is how ML is obtained by combining **three main components**: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data** that consists of basic units of information called **data points**. Data points are defined by their properties which we roughly divide into two fundamentally different groups. \n",
    " * The first group of properties is referred to as the **features** of a data point. Each data point is characterized by (typically a lot of) features, which we stack into a feature vector $\\mathbf{x}=\\big(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\big)^{T}$. Features are properties of a data point that can be measured or computed in an automated fashion without requiring extensive human supervision. Consider data points representing smartphone snapshots. Each snapshot can be characterized by the red, green and blue intensities of each pixel as its features. \n",
    " * Another group of properties that characterizes individual data points is referred to as **labels**. The label $y$ of a data point typically represents some higher-level fact or quantity of interest. In contrast to features, the label of a data point can often only be determined by a human expert. Consider a data point representing a smartphone snapshot. We could then define the label of this datapoint as $y=1$ if the snapshot contains a cat or $y=0$ if the snapshot does not contain a cat. We speak of regression problems when data points have numeric labels $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and of classification problems when the labels take on values only from a finite set such as $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ or $y \\in \\{\"\\mbox{cat image}\",\"\\mbox{not a cat image}\"\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A **hypothesis space** that contains (many) different hypothesis or predictor maps $h(\\mathbf{x})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A **loss function** that measures the quality of a prediction output by a predictor function.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods learn by searching the hypothesis space for a predictor function that results in the smallest average loss on a (training) dataset. We will demonstrate how Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn can be used to implement the components of ML methods. The ultimate goal of this round is to equip you with all the skills required to implement a complete ML mehtod in Python. \n",

    "## Data (Features and labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods learn a hypothesis that allows to predict some phenomenon such as the next days temperature or the shopping behaviour of customers. The learning is based on continuously adapting the hypothesis based on the discrepancy between its predictions and actual observed **data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods view data as collections of atomic units of information called **data points**. A data point can represent very different things or objects. Data points might represent different days, different countries, different persons or different planets. The concept of data points is very abstract and, in turn, highly flexible. However, it is important to clearly define the meaning of data points when starting to develop ML applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods rarely have complete information about a data point but can only access a small number of properties or **features** $\\left(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\right)$. Features are properties of a data point which can be measured easily in an automated fashion. Maybe the most important characteristic of features is that they can be determined without requiring human experts. Another type of properties of data points are referred to as **labels**. We can think of the label of a data point as some higher-level information or quantity of interest. In contrast to features, labels are properties of data points that can often be determined only with the help of human experts. We refer to data points whose labels are known as **labeled data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML can *roughly* be divided into **supervised**- and **unsupervised** learning. Supervised learning is applied to problems in which we attempt to predict the label $y$ of data points based on its features, and requires access to a set of labeled data. A supervised ML model uses the labeled data points as examples to learn a predictor function $h(\\mathbf{x})$ that takes the features $\\mathbf{x}$ of a data point as input and outputs a predicted label $\\hat{y} = h(\\mathbf{x})$. The trained model can then be used to predict the labels of data points for which the true labels are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to supervised methods, unsupervised methods do not require the data to be labeled and are in general used for problems related to the structure and distribution of the data. Examples of unsupervised ML methods are clustering algorithms, which aim to identify different clusters of data points in the dataset, and generative models that are used to generate data (see this [cool example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Features and Labels \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate the main ML terminology using a concrete example. Imagine that we want to build a model for classifying songs according to their genre (such as \"Pop\", \"Blues\" or \"Hip-Hop\"). In this case, the **data points** are songs, with each song corresponding to a specific data point. The data points (=songs) are characterized by the **features** of the data point, which in this case are the city where the song was produced, the length of the song's lyrics, its tempo, and the power spectrum of the audio signal. The quantity of interest or **label** is in this case the genre to which the song belongs to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train a machine learning model to predict the genre (class) of different songs (data points), we need a labeled training dataset consisting of songs for which the genre is known. This dataset can then be used as the input to a supervised ML algorithm, which learns a predictor $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\hat y$ that maps the features of a song to a predicted label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any machine learning scenario requires some degree of domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "No matter how big, well collected and noise-free dataset we had for, say, daytime temperatures and air humidity in Rovaniemi (features), we could not use it to train an effective model to predict the number of euros in Alex's bank account (labels). When choosing features for a particular learning problem, some background assumptions (implicit or explicit) have to be made about the connection between features and labels - we can not learn a pattern that doesn't exist. In real-life scenarios, the exact relationship between features and labels is of course unknown - that is what we are trying to learn. Ideally, we might like to work with features we know are all relevant to the learning task at hand. However, more often than not we have to (and even want to) include a large number of features without any certainty that they are all even relevant or informative. Fortunately, many modern ML methods, including many of those we will cover in this course, can still be effective despite partially uninformative or \"noisy\" features."

Visual exploration of the dataset is often beneficial before applying ML methods since it can aid in identifying relationships between the variables in the data.\n",

The scatterplot visualizes the data with respect to two different variables and can be used to assess the relationship between a single feature and the label, or the relationship between two distinct features. Another useful plot type is the [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram), which is often used for visualizing the sample distribution of the data with respect to a single numerical variable."

    "## Hypothesis Space \n",
    "\n",
    "When applying a ML model on labeled data, we want the model to learn a predictor function $h(\\mathbf{x})$ that takes the features of a data point as input and outputs a predicted label $\\hat{y}$. Ideally, we would like our ML model to be able to learn any possible function so that it can find the one that best represents the relationship between the features and the label. This is, however, impossible in practice, and therefore we have to restrict the set of functions that the ML model can learn. This restricted set of predictor functions is referred to as the **hypothesis space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of hypothesis space corresponds to an assumption about the relationship between the features and the label of a data point. For example, by selecting the set of linear functions of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    h(x) = w \\cdot x, \\; \\text{ where } w \\in \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "as the hypothesis space in the chin-up problem, we are effectively assuming that the relationship between the weight and the number of chin-ups can be approximated well using a linear function. It is important to understand that such assumptions can rarely be justified in advance, and it is in practice necessary to experiment with models using different hypothesis spaces to find the one that results in the best predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the example above, let us choose the set of linear functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    h(x) = w \\cdot x, \\; \\text{ where } w \\in \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "as the hypothesis space for the chin-up problem. The predictor functions take as input the weight $x$ of an athlete and return a prediction $\\hat{y} = wx$ of the number of chin-ups the athlete can perform. Note that each possible value of the coefficient $w$ corresponds to a particular predictor function, and thus the learning algorithm can search for the best predictor by tuning the value of $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, $w$ is the sole **model parameter** of the ML model. Model parameters are variables that the learning algorithm tunes during the training process in order to find the best predictor function in the hypothesis space. Models with larger hypothesis spaces than our tiny example have a larger number of parameters. An extreme example is the [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) deep learning model, which has ~175 billion model parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the optimal predictor for four polynomial hypothesis spaces, as well as the form of the predictor functions in the respective spaces. We can see that whereas the first-degree polynomials in the hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}^{(2)}$ are parametrized by the linear term $w_1$ and intercept $w_0$, the third-degree polynomials in $H^{(4)}$ are parametrized by a larger collection of parameters $(w_0, w_1, w_2, w_3)$.

    "## Learning by Minimizing Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods search for a predictor function in its hypothesis space that accurately predicts the label of any data point. To this end, we define a **loss function** $L((\\mathbf{x}, y), h)$, which quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted label $\\hat{y}=h(\\mathbf{x})$ and the true label $y$ of a data point. The loss function is a design choice that must balance between the computational complexity (some loss functions are easier to minimize) and statistical properties (some loss functions are more robust to outliers in the training data). In general, the loss function value is small if the predicted label is close to the true label. \n",
    "\n",
    "We highlight that we need to know the true label value $y$ of a data point to evaluate the loss $L((\\mathbf{x}, y), h)$. Most ML methods need to be fed with a set of labeled datapoints $\\mathcal{D} = \\big\\{ \\big(\\mathbf{x}^{(1)},y^{(1)}\\big),\\ldots,\\big(\\mathbf{x}^{(m)},y^{(m)}\\big) \\big\\}$. The dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ is referred to as being labeled since it contains datapoints for which we know the true label values. These \"labeled\" datapoints are then used as a training set by ML method in the following sense. ML methods learn a predictor map $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that incurs minimal **average loss** $\\mathcal{E}$ on the training data $\\mathcal{D}$, \n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We slightly abuse notation and use the $L(y, \\hat y)$ shorthand for any loss function that depends on the features $\\mathbf{x}$ only via the predicted label $\\hat y = h(x)$. \n",
    "The average loss $\\mathcal{E}\\big(h|\\mathcal{D} \\big)$ is the average of the individual losses incurred by using the predictor $h$ to predict the labels of the individual data points in the training set. We sometimes refer to the average loss of a predictor on the training set as the **training error**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we are free to define the loss function to best suit the statistical properties of the data and computational resources at hand. However, for certain classes of machine learning problems some useful choices for the loss functions have crystalized. For example, if the labels of data points take on numeric values, a widely used choice for the loss function is the **squared error loss**: \n",

    "\n",
    "We will use this loss function to fit a linear model to the chin-up data in our example problem. In this case, learning the best predictor function corresponds to finding the value of $w$ that minimizes the **mean squared error** (MSE):\n",

    "    \n",
    "The `LinearRegression` class in Scikit-learn implements a standard linear regression model. In the code snippet below, we use this class to fit a linear regression model **without an intercept** to the Linnerud data, and use the fitted model to calculate the predicted labels for the training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The steps we take are the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- First, we create an instance of the `LinearRegression` class. This is done with the statement `LinearRegression(...)`. When creating this object, we can pass different parameters to the constructor that will affect the functionality of the model. For example, the parameter `fit_intercept` determines whether or not the model includes an intercept in its predictor functions\n",
    "    \n",

    "### Adding an Intercept Term \n",
    "\n",
    "From the figure above, we can identify a significant issue with the current hypothesis space consisting of functions $h(x) = wx$. Namely, that for all functions $h(0)=0$, i.e., the functions always cross the origin. This severely restricts linear functions the ML model can learn, and in this particular problem, prohibits learning any function with a negative relationship between the weight and chin-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this issue by selecting a different hypothesis space for our model. Specifically, we select a model that uses predictor functions of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "h(x) = w \\cdot x + b, \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which contain a weight $w$ and an intercept term $b$. By including the intercept term, we allow the predictor functions to cross (intercept) the y-axis at any value $b$ on the axis since $h(0)=b$. Observe that this model has two model parameters - $w$ and $b$. Thus, the model is fitted by minimizing the average squared error of $h(x)$ with respect to both $w$ and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When including an intercept term, the hypothesis space contains all possible linear functions, instead of only those that cross the origin. Thus, it is always preferable to include the intercept term, except for rare cases where we know in advance that the regression line must pass through the origin. "

    "By observing the figure above, we can see that the inclusion of the intercept leads to very different results and conclusions in the chin-up problem. While the model without the intercept seemed to suggest that heavier athletes are, on average, able to do more chin-ups than their lighter counterparts, the model with the intercept suggests the opposite. So which model is more likely to be correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without explicitly calculating the training error, we are able to assert that model with the intercept fits the training data better. This is due to the fact that the intercept model is trained by minimizing the MSE with respect to both $w$ and $b$, whereas the other model only minimizes with respect to $w$. If the optimal linear predictor would cross the origin, the learning algorithm used to train the intercept model would find the optimal value of $b$ to be $b=0$ and both models would result in the same predictor. Since this is not the case, we know that the intercept model fits better!"

    "\n",
    "* **classification** Classification is the task of determining a discrete-valued label $y$ of a data point based solely on its features $\\mathbf{x}$. The label $y$ belongs to a finite set, such as $y \\in \\{−1, 1\\}$, or $y \\in \\{1,..., 19\\}$ and represents a category to which the corresponding data point belongs to. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **data** A set of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **data point** A data point is any object that conveys information. Data points might be students, radio signals, trees, forests, images, RVs, real numbers or proteins. We characterize data points using two types of properties. One type of property is referred to as a feature. Features are properties of a data point that can be measured or computed in an automated fashion. Another type of property is referred to as a label. The label of a data point represents a higher-level facts or quantities of interest. In contrast to features, determining the label of a data point typically requires human experts (domain experts). Roughly speaking, ML aims at predicting the label of a data point based solely on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **features** Features are those properties of a data point that can be measured or computed in an automated fashion. For example, if a data point is a bitmap image, then we could use the red-green-blue intensities of its pixels as features. Some widely used synonyms for the term feature are “covariate”,“explanatory variable”, “independent variable”, “input (variable)”, “predictor (variable)” or “regressor”. Here we use the term features for the low-level properties of data points that can be measured eaisily. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **hypothesis** A map (or function) $h: \\mathcal X → \\mathcal Y$ from the feature space $ \\mathcal X$ to the label space $ \\mathcal Y$. Given a data point with features $\\mathbf{x}$ we use a hypothesis map to estimate (or approximate) the label $y$ using the predicted label $\\hat y = h(\\mathbf{x})$. ML is about learning (finding) a hypothesis map such that $y \\approx h(\\mathbf{x})$ for any data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **hypothesis space or model** Every practical ML method uses a specific hypothesis space (or model) $\\mathcal H$. The hypothesis space of a ML method is a subset of all possible maps from the feature space to label space. The design choice of the hypothesis space should take into account available computational resources and statistical aspects. If the computational infrastructure allows for efficient matrix operations and we expect a linear relation between feature values and label, a resonable first candidate for the hypothesis space is the space of linear maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **label** A higher level fact or quantity of interest associated with a data point. If a data point is an image, its label might be the fact that it shows a cat (or not). Some widely used synonyms for the term label are ”response variable”, ”output variable” or ”target”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **linear regression** Linear regression aims at learning a linear hypothesis map to predict a numeric label based on numeric features of a data point. The quality of a linear hypothesis map is typically measured using the average squared error loss incurred on a set of labeled data points (the training set).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **loss function** A loss function is a function which assigns a pair consisting of a datapoint, with features $\\mathbf{x}$ and label $y$, and a hypothesis $h \\in \\mathcal H$ the non-negative real number $L((\\mathbf{x}, y), h)$. The loss value$L((\\mathbf{x}, y), h)$ quantifies the discrepancy between the true label $y$ and the predicted label $h(\\mathbf{x})$. Smaller (closer to zero) values $L((\\mathbf{x}, y), h)$ mean a smaller discrepancy between predicted label and true label of a data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **predictor/ predictor function/ predictor map**  A predictor is a hypothesis whose function values are numeric, such as real numbers. Given a data point with features $\\mathbf{x}$, the predictor value $h(\\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is used as a prediction (estimate/guess/approximation) for the true numeric label $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ of the data point."
